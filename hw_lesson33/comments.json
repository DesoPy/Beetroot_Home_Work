        "I've been maintaining a cloud-based email service for 25 years. I assure you there is no permanent solution, it's an ongoing arms race that everyone is exhausted fighting. Blocking individual email addresses, which are mostly faked anyway, is futile. These days it's all about trying to parse the content of the email to determine if it's spam. The only people making decent progress on this front are Google, because of the sheer number of people using the service, they can real-time crowd-source spam flagging and reduce it somewhat. That's what Microsoft's trying to get you to do with sending in spam reports, if enough people do that they can catch spam before it reaches you, but it's clear to me Microsoft has not put in the engineering necessary for that yet.\n\nThe ultimate solution is leaving email behind. As a species, we are wasting so many billions of hours wading through junk email, and it won't get better. I'm not sure what to replace it with, though. I don't think the solution has been invented yet.",
