Just because a language can handle large data sets better than Python, doesn't mean they also fail with other tasks a developer may need.\n\nWhat is more interesting is why Python developers get their panties in a twist when people suggest that just maybe there are better languages for a specific project than Python.   Python is good enough right now that it doesn't need to be able to do everything!   Leave those niche development projects to other languages is all I'm saying and focus on Pythons strengths.",
