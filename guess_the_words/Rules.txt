Rules of the game.
You have 6 attempts to guess the five letters word.
When trying to guess a word, the program displays hints in the following form:
- if the letter does not appear in the puzzled word, a dot (.) is placed in its place;
- if the letter is found, but in another place - a question mark (?);
- if there is a letter, it is in the correct position - an exclamation mark (!).
The number of "guessed letters" (ie the total number of '?' and '!')
does not exceed the actual number of re-entered letters in the guessed word.

Points are awarded in the game under the following conditions:
1. If the word is guessed the first time, the player gets 100 points.
2. Each subsequent attempt reduces the maximum number of points by 10 (that is, if the word is guessed in 6 attempts,
the player receives 50 points)
3. Points are additionally awarded, taking into account correctly entered guessed letters with a coefficient
of 0.5 if the letter is guessed correctly and is in its place and 0.25 if the letter is guessed but is in another place.
